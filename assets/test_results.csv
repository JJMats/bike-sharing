1,100,0.1,2,1,0.91,1.31,First run
2,100,0.1,5,1,0.76,1.28,"Increased hidden nodes, helps slightly"
3,100,0.1,10,1,0.693,1.248,"Increased hidden nodes, helps slightly"
4,200,0.1,10,1,0.598,0.971,"Increased iterations, seems to help"
5,300,0.1,10,1,0.585,1.002,"Increased iterations further, doesn't help much"
6,300,1,10,1,0.269,0.47,"Increased learning rate, helps a lot"
7,100,1,10,1,0.565,0.826,"Decreased iterations, hurts the model because the validation loss starts to increase ~80 iterations"
8,80,1,10,1,0.398,0.677,"Decreased iterations further, helps slightly"
9,150,0.5,10,1,0.347,0.57,"Increased iterations and decreased learning rate, helps"
10,300,0.5,10,1,0.304,0.475,"Increased iterations, seems to help"
11,300,0.5,15,1,0.431,0.596,"Increased hidden nodes, which hurt"
12,300,0.5,20,1,0.303,0.467,"Increased hidden nodes further, seems to help"
13,300,0.5,30,1,0.458,0.777,"Increased hidden nodes, probably not enough iterations at the specified learning rate"
14,500,0.5,30,1,0.333,0.547,"Increased iterations, seems to help"
15,500,0.75,30,1,0.892,1.385,"Learning rate too high, could not converge?"
16,500,0.25,30,1,0.396,0.587,Lots of bouncing. Learning rate too low?
17,500,0.33,30,1,0.293,0.469,"Less bouncing, better convergence"
18,500,0.4,30,1,0.273,0.473,"Smooth curves, good convergence"
19,500,0.6,30,1,0.956,1.307,"Rapid convergence, then flat lines. Learning rate too high"
20,500,0.45,30,1,0.266,0.453,Good convergence
21,700,0.45,30,1,0.258,0.426,"Better with more iterations, but diminishing returns"
22,1000,0.45,30,1,0.238,0.399,"Increased iterations, seems to help"
23,2500,0.45,30,1,0.084,0.183,Slight increase in validation loss at ~2300
24,5000,0.45,30,1,0.062,0.143,Validation loss is still decreasing
25,10000,0.45,30,1,0.056,0.14,Diminishing returns. Curve flatlines at ~4500 iterations
26,10000,0.45,50,1,0.139,0.27,Increasing the hidden nodes doesn't help much
27,10000,0.33,50,1,0.084,0.172,"Major kick down at ~6000 iterations, validation loss stops decreasing at ~8000 iterations"
28,4500,0.45,30,1,0.067,0.146,Seems to generalize well
